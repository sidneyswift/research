Once a session exists, use these operations to read, update, archive, or delete it. See
Start a session
for creating a session and sending it work.
Session statuses

Sessions progress through these statuses. See
Start a session
for the session lifecycle.
Status
Description
idle
Agent is waiting for input, including user messages or tool confirmations. Sessions created without
initial_events
start in
idle
. A session can be
idle
while a
workflow run
is still open, so
idle
alone doesn’t mean that the work is done. See
Know when the work is done
.
running
Agent is actively executing.
rescheduling
Transient error occurred, retrying automatically.
terminated
Session has ended, either because of an unrecoverable error or because it was archived. A session that completes its work goes
idle
, not
terminated
.
Updating the agent configuration

You can update a session’s
agent.tools
and
agent.mcp_servers
, including permission policies and per-tool web settings such as
domain filters
, mid-session without creating a new agent version. Updates are session-local and do not apply to the underlying agent. Updated
allowed_domains
and
blocked_domains
apply to the rest of the session.
Only the agent’s
tools
and
mcp_servers
can change after a session is created. To run a session with
model
,
system
, or
skills
values other than the agent’s, use
agent configuration overrides
when you create the session. The agent’s model configuration, including its
inference_geo
pin, also can’t change mid-session: set the pin when you save the agent, or set or clear it for a single session with a
model
override when you create it. The agent’s configured
system
field is fixed for the session’s lifetime. On models that support it, you can still append system-level guidance mid-session by sending a
system.message
event
.
The semantics of a
tools
or
mcp_servers
update are full replacement: the provided array is the new value. To preserve existing entries,
GET
the session, modify the array, and
POST
it back.
The session must be
idle
to update the agent. To update the agent while the session is running, send a
user.interrupt
event
by itself and wait for the session to become
idle
. If a
workflow run
is open, whether it’s running or paused, the update returns a 400 error, even when the session is
idle
. An interrupt doesn’t end a run, so the update still fails after you interrupt the session. Send a
user.message
that
asks the agent to stop its runs
, or wait until every run has ended.

Updating the session budget

A session
created with a budget
accepts two kinds of budget update: replacing the cap with a new
max_list_cost
, and removing it by passing
budget=None
. Both automatically resume work that paused when the session reached its cap. A replacement cap can be higher or lower than the current one, but it must be strictly greater than the session’s consumed list cost. Removal is one-way: a non-null
budget
is accepted only on a session that currently has one. You therefore can’t re-add a removed budget or add one to a session created without it. See
Session budgets
for request examples, the error behaviors, and what counts toward list cost.

Listing sessions

Results from
GET /v1/sessions
are paginated. Use the
limit
query parameter to control the page size. Each response includes a
next_page
cursor; pass it as the
page
parameter on the next request to fetch the following page.
next_page
is
null
when there are no more results.
To go back a page, pass
prev_page
as the
page
parameter.
prev_page
is
null
when you’re on the first page.
A
page
cursor is opaque and encodes the
order
of the request that produced it. The
order
query parameter sets the sort direction of the results,
asc
or
desc
by creation time; the default is
desc
(newest first). Reusing a cursor with a different
order
returns a 400 error, as does changing a
created_at
filter so that it excludes the cursor’s position. Other query parameters, including the remaining filters and
limit
, can change between paginated requests. For the pagination fields shared across list endpoints, see
Pagination
.

Archiving a session

Archive a session to prevent new events from being sent while preserving its history. A
running
session cannot be archived; to archive one, send a
user.interrupt
event
by itself and wait for the session to become
idle
. If a
workflow run
is open, archiving might return a 400 error, even when the session is
idle
, or it might succeed and end the run. Before you archive, send a
user.message
that
asks the agent to stop its runs
, or wait until each run has ended. Then archive the session once it’s
idle
.

Deleting a session

Deleting a session is permanent. It deletes the session’s record, events, and associated sandbox. A
running
session cannot be deleted; to delete one, send a
user.interrupt
event
by itself and wait for the session to become
idle
. If a
workflow run
is open, deleting might return a 400 error, even when the session is
idle
, or it might succeed. After a delete that succeeds, no
workflow_run
event reports the end of the session’s runs. Before you delete, send a
user.message
that
asks the agent to stop its runs
, or wait until each run has ended. Then delete the session once it’s
idle
.
Memory stores, vaults, skills, environments, and agents are independent resources and are not affected by session deletion. Files you uploaded through the Files API are also unaffected, but files the session itself produced are scoped to it and are permanently deleted along with its filesystem. Download anything you need to keep before deleting the session. An output file written at the end of the last turn can take a few seconds after the session goes idle to appear in the
session’s file list
, so check that the files you expect are listed first.
