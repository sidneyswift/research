Batch processing is a powerful approach for handling large volumes of requests efficiently. Instead of processing requests one at a time with immediate responses, batch processing allows you to submit multiple requests together for asynchronous processing. This pattern is particularly useful when:
You need to process large volumes of data
Immediate responses are not required
You want to optimize for cost efficiency
You’re running large-scale evaluations or analyses
The Message Batches API is Anthropic’s first implementation of this pattern.
Message Batches API

requests. This approach is well-suited to tasks that do not require immediate responses, with most batches finishing in less than 1 hour while reducing costs by 50 percent and increasing throughput.
You can
explore the API reference directly
, in addition to this guide.
How the Message Batches API works

When you send a request to the Message Batches API:
The system creates a new Message Batch with the provided Messages requests.
The batch is then processed asynchronously, with each request handled independently.
You can poll for the status of the batch and retrieve results when processing has ended for all requests.
This is especially useful for bulk operations that don’t require immediate results, such as:
Large-scale evaluations: Process thousands of test cases efficiently.
Content moderation: Analyze large volumes of user-generated content asynchronously.
Data analysis: Generate insights or summaries for large datasets.
Bulk content generation: Create large amounts of text for various purposes (for example, product descriptions, article summaries).
Batch limitations

A Message Batch is limited to either 100,000 Message requests or 256 MB in size, whichever is reached first.
The system processes each batch as fast as possible, with most batches completing within 1 hour. You can access batch results when all messages have completed or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Batches expire if processing does not complete within 24 hours.
Batch results are available for 29 days after creation. After that, you can still view the Batch, but its results will no longer be available for download.
Batches are scoped to a
Workspace
in the Claude Console. You may view all batches (and their results) that were created within the Workspace your request runs in.
Rate limits apply to both Batches API HTTP requests and the number of requests within a batch waiting to be processed. See
Message Batches API rate limits
. Additionally, processing might be slowed down based on current demand and your request volume. In that case, you might see more requests expiring after 24 hours.
Because of high throughput and concurrent processing, batches may go slightly over the
spend limit
configured in the Claude Console for your Workspace.
Each batched request must have
max_tokens

of at least
1
.
max_tokens: 0
(
cache pre-warming
) is not supported inside a batch, because an ephemeral cache entry written during batch processing would likely expire before the follow-up request runs.
Supported models

All
active models
support the Message Batches API.
What can be batched

Almost any request you can make to the Messages API can be included in a batch. This includes:
Vision
Tool use, including all
server tools
(web search, web fetch, code execution, MCP connectors, advisor, and tool search)
System messages
Multi-turn conversations
Extended thinking
Most beta features
Because each request in the batch is processed independently, you can mix different types of requests within a single batch.
A small number of Messages API parameters are
not
supported in batch requests. Including any of these returns a validation error:
Parameter
Why
stream: true
Batch results come back as a single file, not a stream.
speed
(
Fast mode
)
Fast mode tunes synchronous latency, which doesn’t apply to asynchronous batch processing.
fallbacks
(
Server-side fallback
)
Server-side fallback doesn’t apply to batches. To retry refused requests, see
Refusals in Message Batches
.
max_tokens: 0
See
Batch limitations
.

Because batches can take longer than 5 minutes to process, consider using the
1-hour cache duration
with prompt caching for better cache hit rates when processing batches with shared context.
Pricing

The Batches API offers significant cost savings. All usage is charged at 50 percent of the standard API prices.

How to use the Message Batches API

Prepare and create your batch

A Message Batch is composed of a list of requests to create a Message. The shape of an individual request comprises:
A unique

Test your batch requests with the Messages API
Validation of the
params
object for each message request is performed asynchronously, and validation errors are returned when processing of the entire batch has ended. You can ensure that you are building your input correctly by verifying your request shape with the
Messages API
first.
When a batch is first created, the response has a processing status of
in_progress
.

Retrieving batch results

Once batch processing has ended, each Messages request in the batch has a result. There are four result types:
Result type
Description
succeeded
Request was successful. Includes the message result.
errored
Request encountered an error and a message was not created. Possible errors include invalid requests and internal server errors. You will not be billed for these requests.
canceled
User canceled the batch before this request could be sent to the model. You will not be billed for these requests.
expired
Batch reached its 24-hour expiration before this request could be sent to the model. You will not be billed for these requests.
The batch’s
request_counts
object counts the requests still processing and the requests with each result type.


If your result has an error, its
result.error
will be set to the standard
error shape
.
Batch results use the API version of the request that created the batch.

Batch results may not match input order
Batch results can be returned in any order, and may not match the ordering of requests when the batch was created. In the preceding example, the result for the second batch request is returned before the first. To correctly match results with their corresponding requests, always use the
custom_id
field.
Canceling a Message Batch

You can cancel a Message Batch that is currently processing using the
cancel endpoint
Preview with links to the API reference available — press Tab until focus enters the card, Escape to return.
. Immediately after cancellation, a batch’s
processing_status
will be
canceling
. You can use the same polling technique described earlier to wait until cancellation is finalized. Canceled batches end up with a status of
ended
and may contain partial results for requests that were processed before cancellation.

Using prompt caching with Message Batches

The Message Batches API supports prompt caching, allowing you to potentially reduce costs and processing time for batch requests. The pricing discounts from prompt caching and Message Batches can stack, providing even greater cost savings when both features are used together. However, because batch requests are processed asynchronously and concurrently, cache hits are provided on a best-effort basis. Users typically experience cache hit rates ranging from 30 percent to 98 percent, depending on their traffic patterns.
To maximize the likelihood of cache hits in your batch requests:
Include identical
cache_control
blocks in every Message request within your batch.
Maintain a steady stream of requests to prevent cache entries from expiring after their 5-minute lifetime.
Structure your requests to share as much cached content as possible.

In this example, both requests in the batch include identical system messages and the full text of Pride and Prejudice marked with
cache_control
to increase the likelihood of cache hits.
Server tools and the agentic loop

All
server tools
(web search, web fetch, code execution, MCP connectors, advisor, and tool search) work in batch requests. The batch worker runs the same server-side agentic loop as the synchronous Messages API.
Because there is no open connection to maintain, the batch loop can run
more iterations in a turn
than a synchronous request before it returns
stop_reason: "pause_turn"
. If a batch result comes back with
pause_turn
, the turn did not complete; you can continue it by submitting the paused assistant content in a follow-up request (batch or synchronous) exactly as shown in the
pause_turn continuation pattern
.
The batch worker additionally throttles
web_search
for each organization so that highly concurrent batch processing does not exhaust your organization’s web-search rate limit. The batch retries throttled requests automatically; you don’t need to handle this yourself, but very large web-search batches might take longer to complete.
Extended output (beta)

The
output-300k-2026-03-24
beta header raises the
max_tokens
cap to 300,000 for batch requests using Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Opus 5, Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 5.5, Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Sonnet 4.6, or Claude Haiku 5.5. Include the header to generate outputs far longer than the standard 128k
max_tokens
limit in a single turn.

Extended output is available on the Message Batches API only, not the synchronous Messages API. It is supported on the Claude API and Claude Platform on AWS, and is not currently available on Amazon Bedrock, Claude Models on Google Cloud (Google managed), or Microsoft Foundry.
Use extended output for long-form generation such as book-length drafts and technical documentation, exhaustive structured data extraction, large code-generation scaffolds, and long reasoning chains.
A single 300k-token generation can take over an hour to complete, so plan your batch submissions with the 24-hour processing window in mind. Standard batch pricing (50 percent of standard API prices) applies.

Best practices for effective batching

To use the Batches API effectively:
Monitor batch processing status regularly and implement appropriate retry logic for failed requests.
Use meaningful
custom_id
values to easily match results with requests, because order is not guaranteed.
Consider breaking very large datasets into multiple batches for better manageability.
Dry run a single request shape with the Messages API to avoid validation errors.
Troubleshooting common issues

If experiencing unexpected behavior:
Verify that the total batch request size doesn’t exceed 256 MB. If the request size is too large, you might get a 413
request_too_large
error.
Check that you’re using
supported models
for all requests in the batch.
Ensure each request in the batch has a unique
custom_id
.
Ensure that it has been less than 29 days since batch
created_at
(not processing
ended_at
) time. If over 29 days have passed, results will no longer be viewable.
Confirm that the batch has not been canceled.
Note that the failure of one request in a batch does not affect the processing of other requests.
Batch storage and privacy

Workspace isolation:
Batches are isolated within the Workspace they are created in. They can only be accessed by API requests in that same Workspace, or users with permission to view Workspace batches in the Console.
Result availability:
Batch results are available for 29 days after the batch is created, allowing ample time for retrieval and processing.
FAQ

How long does it take for a batch to process?

Batches might take up to 24 hours for processing, but many complete sooner. Actual processing time depends on the size of the batch, current demand, and your request volume. It is possible for a batch to expire and not complete within 24 hours.
Is the Batches API available for all models?

See
Supported models
for the list of supported models.
Can I use the Message Batches API with other API features?

Yes, the Message Batches API supports nearly all features available in the Messages API, including most beta features. A small number of parameters (
stream
,
speed
,
fallbacks
, and
max_tokens: 0
) are not supported. See
What can be batched
for the full list.
How does the Message Batches API affect pricing?

The Message Batches API offers a 50 percent discount on all usage compared to standard API prices. This applies to input tokens, output tokens, and any special tokens. For more on pricing, visit
Pricing
.
Can I update a batch after it’s been submitted?

No, once a batch has been submitted, it cannot be modified. If you need to make changes, cancel the current batch and submit a new one. Note that cancellation might not take immediate effect.
Are there Message Batches API rate limits and do they interact with the Messages API rate limits?

The Message Batches API has HTTP requests-based rate limits in addition to limits on the number of requests in need of processing. See
Message Batches API rate limits
. Usage of the Batches API does not affect rate limits in the Messages API.
How do I handle errors in my batch requests?

When you retrieve the results, each request has a
result
field indicating whether it
succeeded
,
errored
, was
canceled
, or
expired
. For
errored
results, additional error information is provided. View the error response object in the
API reference
.
How does the Message Batches API handle privacy and data separation?

The Message Batches API is designed with strong privacy and data separation measures:
Batches and their results are isolated within the Workspace in which they were created. This means they can only be accessed by API requests in that same Workspace.
Each request within a batch is processed independently, with no data leakage between requests.
Results are only available for a limited time (29 days), and follow Anthropic’s
data retention policy
.
Downloading batch results in the Console can be disabled on the organization level or on a per-workspace basis.
Can I use prompt caching in the Message Batches API?

Yes, it is possible to use prompt caching with the Message Batches API. However, because asynchronous batch requests can be processed concurrently and in any order, cache hits are provided on a best-effort basis.
