This page covers the tool-call lifecycle: reading
tool_use
blocks from Claude’s response, formatting
tool_result
blocks in your reply, and signaling errors. For the SDK abstraction that handles this automatically, see
Tool Runner
.

Simpler with Tool Runner:
The manual tool handling described on this page is automatically managed by
Tool Runner
. Use this page when you need custom control over tool execution.
Claude’s response differs based on whether it uses a
client or server tool
.
Handling results from client tools

The response has a
stop_reason
of
tool_use
and one or more
tool_use
content blocks that include:
id
: A unique identifier for this particular tool use block. This is used to match up the tool results later.
name
: The name of the tool being used.
input
: An object containing the input being passed to the tool, conforming to the tool’s
input_schema
.
A
tool_use
block for a member of the
computer use
or
browser use
toolset also carries a
toolset_name
field (
"computer"
or
"browser"
). Its
name
is the member tool Claude is calling, such as
screenshot
or
navigate
, so dispatch those blocks on both fields.
Example API response with a `tool_use` content block

JSON

{
"id"
:
"msg_01Aq9w938a90dw8q"
,
"model"
:
"claude-opus-5-5"
,
"stop_reason"
:
"tool_use"
,
"role"
:
"assistant"
,
"content"
: [
{
"type"
:
"text"
,
"text"
:
"I'll check the current weather in San Francisco for you."
},
{
"type"
:
"tool_use"
,
"id"
:
"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9"
,
"name"
:
"get_weather"
,
"input"
: {
"location"
:
"San Francisco, CA"
,
"unit"
:
"celsius"
}
}
]
}
When you receive a tool use response for a client tool, you should:
Extract the
name
,
id
, and
input
from the
tool_use
block.
Run the actual tool in your code base corresponding to that tool name, passing in the tool
input
.
Continue the conversation by sending a new message with the
role
of
user
, and a
content
block containing the
tool_result
type and the following information:
tool_use_id
: The
id
of the tool use request this is a result for.
content
(optional): The result of the tool, as a string (for example,
"content": "15 degrees"
), a list of nested content blocks (for example,
"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "15 degrees"}]
), or a list of document blocks (for example,
"content": [{"type": "document", "source": {"type": "text", "media_type": "text/plain", "data": "15 degrees"}}]
). These content blocks can use the
text
,
image
,
document
, or
search_result
types.
is_error
(optional): Set to
true
if the tool execution resulted in an error.
For example, a successful tool result looks like this:
JSON

{
"role"
:
"user"
,
"content"
: [
{
"type"
:
"tool_result"
,
"tool_use_id"
:
"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9"
,
"content"
:
"15 degrees"
}
]
}
A
tool_result
that answers a computer use or browser use member block must also echo the same
toolset_name
value as the
tool_use
block; a member result that omits it is rejected. Its
content
is also narrower: a member result may contain only
text
and
image
blocks, and a browser use result may add one
browser_state
block (the
tab-management members
return only that block).

Important formatting requirements:
Tool result blocks must immediately follow their corresponding tool use blocks in the message history. You cannot include any messages between the assistant’s tool use message and the user’s tool result message.
In the user message containing tool results, the
tool_result
blocks must come FIRST in the content array. Any text must come AFTER all tool results.
If the assistant turn also called a
server tool
that has no result block yet, the user message must contain only
tool_result
blocks. Text after the results ends the turn early; for a server tool Claude called directly, the request then fails with a 400 error that names the unresolved server tool. See
Stop reasons and fallback
.
If you receive an error such as “tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks immediately after”, check that your tool results are formatted correctly.

Tool results often carry content from sources outside your control: webpages, inbound email, user uploads, third-party APIs. Treat that content as untrusted: an attacker who can influence it might embed instructions that try to redirect Claude (indirect prompt injection). Keep untrusted content inside
tool_result
blocks rather than
system
prompts or plain user
text
blocks, and see
Mitigate jailbreaks and prompt injections
for further hardening.

}
Example of text before and after a tool result

For example, this causes a 400 error:
{
"role"
:
"user"
,
"content"
: [
{
"type"
:
"text"
,
"text"
:
"Here are the results:"
},
// ❌ Text before tool_result
{
"type"
:
"tool_result"
,
"tool_use_id"
:
"toolu_01"
/* ... */
}
]
}

This is correct when the assistant turn calls only client tools:
{
"role"
:
"user"
,
"content"
: [
{
"type"
:
"tool_result"
,
"tool_use_id"
:
"toolu_01"
/* ... */
},
{
"type"
:
"text"
,
"text"
:
"What should I do next?"
}
// ✅ Text after tool_result
]
}

After receiving the tool result, Claude will use that information to continue generating a response to the original user prompt.
Handling results from server tools

Claude runs the tool internally and incorporates the results directly into its response without requiring additional user interaction.

A response can contain both a client
tool_use
block and a
server_tool_use
block that has no result block. That server tool call is not complete yet, and its result block arrives in a later response. Reply with a user message that contains only the
tool_result
blocks for the client tools and keep the same
tools
array; for a server tool Claude called directly, the API runs it on that request and the next response starts with its result block. See
Stop reasons and fallback
.

Differences from other APIs
Unlike APIs that separate tool use or use special roles like
tool
or
function
, the Claude API integrates tools directly into the
user
and
assistant
message structure.
Messages contain arrays of
text
,
image
,
tool_use
, and
tool_result
blocks.
user
messages include client content and
tool_result
, whereas
assistant
messages contain AI-generated content and
tool_use
.
Handling errors with is_error

There are a few different types of errors that can occur when using tools with Claude:
Tool execution error

If the tool itself throws an error during execution (for example, a network error when fetching weather data), you can return the error message in the
content
along with
"is_error": true
:
JSON

{
"role"
:
"user"
,
"content"
: [
{
"type"
:
"tool_result"
,
"tool_use_id"
:
"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9"
,
"content"
:
"ConnectionError: the weather service API is not available (HTTP 500)"
,
"is_error"
:
true
}
]
}
Claude will then incorporate this error into its response to the user. For example: “I’m sorry, I was unable to retrieve the current weather because the weather service API is not available. Please try again later.”

Write instructive error messages. Instead of generic errors such as
"failed"
, include what went wrong and what Claude should try next (for example,
"Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 60 seconds."
). This gives Claude the context it needs to recover or adapt without guessing.
Invalid tool name

If Claude’s attempted use of a tool is invalid (for example, missing required parameters), it usually means that there wasn’t enough information for Claude to use the tool correctly. The best approach during development is to try the request again with more-detailed
description
values in your tool definitions.
However, you can also continue the conversation forward with a
tool_result
that indicates the error, and Claude will attempt to use the tool again with the missing information filled in:
JSON

{
"role"
:
"user"
,
"content"
: [
{
"type"
:
"tool_result"
,
"tool_use_id"
:
"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9"
,
"content"
:
"Error: Missing required 'location' parameter"
,
"is_error"
:
true
}
]
}
If a tool request is invalid or missing parameters, Claude will retry 2–3 times with corrections before apologizing to the user.

To eliminate invalid tool calls entirely, use
strict tool use
with
strict: true
on your tool definitions. This guarantees that tool inputs always match your schema exactly, preventing missing parameters and type mismatches.
Server tool errors

When server tools encounter errors (for example, network issues with web search), Claude will transparently handle these errors and attempt to provide an alternative response or explanation to the user. Unlike client tools, you do not need to handle
is_error
results for server tools.
For web search specifically, possible error codes include:
too_many_requests
: Rate limit exceeded
invalid_input
: Invalid search query parameter
max_uses_exceeded
: Maximum web search tool uses exceeded
query_too_long
: Query exceeds maximum length
unavailable
: An internal error occurred
